### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key (for future AI features)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set your OpenAI API key for future AI features
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'
   
   # Or create a .env file (recommended)
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env
   ```

### Usage

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
